# Ramon

Ramon is a Javascript visualization framework that encapsulates different visualization libraries such as Highcharts, Google Charts, Fusion Charts, etc.

It provides reusable components and defines an API for the communication with the backend, it also defines a protocol for the description of the data that allows the components to be connected "intelligently".

Ramon comes bundled with a development tool (the workbench) that allows easy creation and preview of the widget components.

MIT licensed, depends on Backbone, jQuery and Require.js
